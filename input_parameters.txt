please enter the following parameters. DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE; just update the values.
	predic_type is the type of prediction; it is assumed to be "interruption" unless "binary" is indicated.
	r (>=4) is the robustness. Enter a value in the range [4,7]
	H is noise upper bound. Enter a value in the range [0.01,0.9]
	noise is "normal" unless "uniform" is indicated (noise is ignored for binary predictions).
	noise_std_dev is the standard deviation of the noise if it is normal (only used if the noise_type is "normal", ignored otherwise). 
	n_points is the number of evenly spaced points for the interruption time (in the range 2, 2^20). Enter a value in the range [10,5000]
	The last lines indicate the values of p for which the algorithms are tested (enter one value per line; there can be less or more than four lines). Enter values in the range [0.01,0.9]
